Hello and welcome to the NASA-SUITS/COSMIC-2024 Github file.

We are a team of 5  individuals from the University of Texas at Austin and we are very excited to be included in this challenge. (Formerly 6 individuals but Ryan Grassman had to step away due to an internship, thanks and congratulations Ryan!)
The mentor for Team COSMIC and our University of Texas advocate is the Professor of our senior capstone design course, Adam Nokes. We appreciate his help with everything he has done for us and everything he will be assisting us with logistically moving forward.
Our group of students is participating in this challenge for our senior design project to obtain our BS in Aerospace engineering with a classpath focus on spaceflight.

The names and  primary roles of our members are as follows :

Jordan Thomas Acampado - Team Lead & Head HMD Design
Dale Daniel - Point of Contact and LMCC Design ( If you're reading this, hello! )
Ty Nelson - Social Media Outreach and General Engineering Design
Luis Chavez - Lead LMCC Design
Matthew Underhill - HMD & LMCC Design
Ryan Grassman - Formerly LMCC and HMD Design 

Team COSMIC works as a cohesive unit and collaborates on all parts of the design to ensure that our finished interface will be both demonstrable and ultimately successful.
We cannot stress how thrilled we are to be here, and we hope to demonstrate our proficiency in augmented reality, and, on a larger scale, our ability to implement successful engineering solutions.

Thanks for reading! For any further contact with Team COSMIC, feel free to contact the Point of Contact  at PhzyksGo4@gmail.com or +1 (210)305-0190.

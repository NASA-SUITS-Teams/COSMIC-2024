Hello and welcome to the NASA-SUITS/COSMIC-2024 Github file.

We are a team of 5 of individuals from the University of Texas at Austin and we are very excited to be included in this challenge. (Formerly 6 indivudals but Ryan Grassman had to step away due to an intership, thanks and congratulations Ryan!)
Our group of students is participating in this challenge for our senior design project to obtain our BS in Aerospace Engingeering with a class path focus on spaceflight.

The names and  primary roles of our members are as follows :

Jordan Thomas Acampado - Team Lead & Head HMD Design
Dale Daniel - Point of Contact and LMCC Design ( If you're reading this, hello! )
Ty Nelson - Social Media Outreach and General Engineering Design
Luis Chavez - Lead LMCC Design
Matthew Underhill - HMD & LMCC Design
Ryan Grassman - Formerly LMCC and HMD Design 

Team COSMIC works as a cohesive unit and collaborates on all parts of the design to ensure that our finished interface will be both demonstrable and ultimately succesful.
We cannot stress how thrilled we are to be here, and we hope to demonstrate our proficiency in augmented reality and on a larger scale , our ability to implement succesful engineering solutions.

Thanks for reading! For any further contact with Team COSMIC, feel free to contact the Point of Contact  at PhzyksGo4@gmail.com or +1 (210)305-0190.
